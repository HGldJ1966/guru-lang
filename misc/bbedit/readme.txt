The Guru Codeless Language Module for BBEdit and TextWrangler

* How to install
Copy guru.plist file to $HOME/Library/Application Support/TextWrangler/Language Modules directory.

* Limitations
Nested comments DO NOT render correctly. That means the inner most comment will end all the comments prematurely. As long as I know, BBEdit codeless language module does not support nested comments. A full-blown plugin might do it.
